# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

Node.js CLI tool for managing Claude Code components (agents, commands, MCPs, hooks, settings) with a static website for browsing and installing components. The dashboard and its API routes are deployed on Cloudflare Pages, with supporting cron and monitoring tasks running as Cloudflare Workers.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm install                    # Install dependencies
npm test                       # Run tests
npm version patch|minor|major  # Bump version
npm publish                    # Publish to npm

# Component catalog
python scripts/generate_components_json.py  # Update docs/components.json

# Dashboard + API (Astro on Cloudflare Pages)
cd dashboard && npm run build  # Build before deploy
npm run deploy                 # Deploy www + app.aitmpl.com via wrangler
```

> Deploys to production happen automatically via GitHub Actions on push to `main`
> (changes in `dashboard/**`). Manual deploy uses `wrangler pages deploy`, not Vercel.

## Security Guidelines

### ⛔ CRITICAL: NEVER Hardcode Secrets or IDs

**NEVER write API keys, tokens, passwords, project IDs, org IDs, or any identifier in code.** This includes Cloudflare account/project IDs, Supabase URLs, Discord IDs, database connection strings, and any other infrastructure identifier. ALL must go in `.env` (or Cloudflare secrets via `wrangler secret put`).

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
const API_KEY = "AIzaSy...";

// ✅ CORRECT
const API_KEY = process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY;
```

**When creating scripts with API keys:**
1. Use `process.env` (Node.js) or `os.environ.get()` (Python)
2. Load from `.env` file using `dotenv`
3. Add variable to `.env.example` with placeholder
4. Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`

**If you accidentally commit a secret:**
1. Revoke the key IMMEDIATELY
2. Generate new key
3. Update `.env`
4. Old key is compromised forever (git history)

## Component System

### Component Types

**Agents** (600+) - AI specialists for development tasks
**Commands** (200+) - Custom slash commands for workflows
**MCPs** (55+) - External service integrations
**Settings** (60+) - Claude Code configuration files
**Hooks** (39+) - Automation triggers
**Loops** (18+) - Autonomous agentic workflows (goal + interval + stop condition) that reference other components
**Templates** (14+) - Complete project configurations

### Installation Patterns

```bash
# Single component
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent frontend-developer
npx claude-code-templates@latest --command setup-testing
npx claude-code-templates@latest --hook automation/simple-notifications
npx claude-code-templates@latest --loop engineering/docs-sweep-loop  # also installs the loop's referenced components

# Batch installation
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent security-auditor --command security-audit --setting read-only-mode

# Interactive mode
npx claude-code-templates@latest
```

### Component Development

#### Adding New Components

**CRITICAL: Use the component-reviewer agent for ALL component changes**

When adding or modifying components, you MUST use the `component-reviewer` subagent to validate the component before committing:

```
Use the component-reviewer agent to review [component-path]
```

**Component Creation Workflow:**

1. Create component file in `cli-tool/components/{type}/{category}/{name}.md`
2. Use descriptive hyphenated names (kebab-case)
3. Include clear descriptions and usage examples
4. **REVIEW with component-reviewer agent** (validates format, security, naming)
5. Fix any issues identified by the reviewer
6. **TEST before generating/publishing**: ask the human in the session whether
   they want to test the newly created/modified component(s) first. Do NOT run
   `generate_components_json.py`, commit, or publish until testing is confirmed
   or explicitly skipped by the user.
7. Run `python scripts/generate_components_json.py` to update catalog

**The component-reviewer agent checks:**
- ✅ Valid YAML frontmatter and required fields
- ✅ Proper kebab-case naming conventions
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- ✅ Relative paths only (no absolute paths)
- ✅ Supporting files exist (for hooks with scripts)
- ✅ Clear, specific descriptions
- ✅ Correct category placement
- ✅ Security best practices

**Example Usage:**
```
# After creating a new agent
Use the component-reviewer agent to review cli-tool/components/agents/development-team/react-expert.md

# Before committing hook changes
Use the component-reviewer agent to review cli-tool/components/hooks/git/prevent-force-push.json

# For PR reviews with multiple components
Use the component-reviewer agent to review all modified components in cli-tool/components/
```

The agent will provide prioritized feedback:
- **❌ Critical Issues**: Must fix before merge (security, missing fields)
- **⚠️ Warnings**: Should fix (clarity, best practices)
- **📋 Suggestions**: Nice to have improvements

#### Skill Security Scanning (SkillSpector)

Skills under `cli-tool/components/skills/**` are scanned for security
vulnerabilities by [SkillSpector](https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector)
(NVIDIA, Apache-2.0) — a static analyzer with 64 vulnerability patterns
(prompt injection, data exfiltration, supply chain, dangerous code/AST, taint
tracking, YARA signatures, etc.). It runs in static-only mode (`--no-llm`), so
no API key or secret is required.

Two GitHub Actions drive it, both via the batch orchestrator
`scripts/skillspector_scan.py`:

- **`.github/workflows/skill-security-scan.yml`** (PR) — scans only the skills
  changed in the PR (`git diff`), posts an idempotent report comment, and
  **blocks** the check if any changed skill scores HIGH/CRITICAL (risk score
  > 50). Uploads an aggregated SARIF to the Security tab.
- **`.github/workflows/skill-security-scan-all.yml`** (weekly + manual) — scans
  all skills, reports to the run summary and SARIF, and **never blocks**.

SkillSpector requires Python 3.12+ and is installed from NVIDIA's `main`
branch (`pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector.git@main`); it
is not published to PyPI. Risk bands: 0-20 LOW, 21-50 MEDIUM, 51-80 HIGH,
81-100 CRITICAL.

#### Statuslines with Python Scripts

Statuslines can reference Python scripts that are auto-downloaded to `.claude/scripts/`:

```javascript
// In src/index.js:installIndividualSetting()
if (settingName.includes('statusline/')) {
  const pythonFileName = settingName.split('/')[1] + '.py';
  const pythonUrl = githubUrl.replace('.json', '.py');
  additionalFiles['.claude/scripts/' + pythonFileName] = {
    content: pythonContent,
    executable: true
  };
}
```

### Publishing Workflow

```bash
# 1. Update component catalog
python scripts/generate_components_json.py

# 2. Run tests
npm test

# 3. Check current npm version and align local version
npm view claude-code-templates version  # check latest on registry
# Edit package.json version to be one patch above the registry version

# 4. Commit version bump and push
git add package.json && git commit -m "chore: Bump version to X.Y.Z"
git push origin main

# 5. Publish to npm (requires granular access token with "Bypass 2FA" enabled)
npm config set //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_GRANULAR_TOKEN
npm publish
npm config delete //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken  # always clean up after

# 6. Tag the release
git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z

# 7. Deploy website (dashboard on Cloudflare Pages)
# Automatic on push to main (GitHub Actions). Manual: from dashboard/ run `npm run deploy`
```

**npm Publishing Notes:**
- Classic npm tokens were revoked Dec 2025. Use **granular access tokens** from [npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens)
- The token must have **Read and Write** permissions for `claude-code-templates` and **"Bypass 2FA"** enabled
- Always remove the token from npm config after publishing (`npm config delete`)
- The local `package.json` version may drift from npm if published from CI — always check `npm view claude-code-templates version` first
- Never hardcode or commit tokens

## API Architecture

### Critical Endpoints

API endpoints live as Astro API routes in `dashboard/src/pages/api/`:

**`/api/track-download-supabase`** (CRITICAL)
- Tracks component downloads for analytics
- Used by CLI on every installation
- Database: Supabase (component_downloads table)

**`/api/discord/interactions`**
- Discord bot slash commands
- Features: /search, /info, /install, /popular

**`/api/claude-code-check`**
- Monitors Claude Code releases
- Triggered every 30 minutes by the `cloudflare-workers/crons` Worker (not a Vercel cron)
- Database: Neon (claude_code_versions, claude_code_changes, discord_notifications_log, monitoring_metadata tables)

### Shared API Libraries

- `dashboard/src/lib/api/cors.ts` — CORS headers, `corsResponse()`, `jsonResponse()`
- `dashboard/src/lib/api/neon.ts` — Neon client factory
- `dashboard/src/lib/api/auth.ts` — Clerk JWT verification
- `dashboard/src/lib/api/changelog-parser.ts` — Claude Code changelog parser

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
# List recent Pages deployments
npx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name=aitmpl-dashboard
# Roll back to a previous deployment
npx wrangler pages deployment rollback <deployment-id> --project-name=aitmpl-dashboard
```

## Cloudflare Workers

The `cloudflare-workers/` directory contains Cloudflare Worker projects that run independently from the dashboard Pages project.

### crons

Replaces the old Vercel cron jobs. On a schedule it calls the dashboard API endpoints (which stay on Cloudflare Pages) with a shared `TRIGGER_SECRET`.

- `*/30 * * * *` → `/api/claude-code-check` (monitors Claude Code npm releases)
- `0 * * * *` → `/api/health-check` (hourly; was every 15 min on Vercel, reduced to save invocations)

Errors and cron check-ins are reported to Sentry (`sentry.js`, DSN from the `aitmpl-workers` project — see Error Tracking below).

```bash
cd cloudflare-workers/crons
npm run dev          # Local dev
npx wrangler deploy  # Deploy
```

**Secrets (Cloudflare):** `DASHBOARD_URL` (e.g. `https://www.aitmpl.com`), `TRIGGER_SECRET`, `SENTRY_DSN` (optional).

### docs-monitor (DECOMMISSIONED 2026-07)

Monitored https://code.claude.com/docs hourly with Telegram notifications. **Deleted from Cloudflare** to free a cron-trigger slot for the newsletter worker (the account's free plan allows 5 cron triggers total). The code remains in `cloudflare-workers/docs-monitor/` and can be redeployed if a slot frees up (`npx wrangler deploy`).

### pulse (Weekly KPI Report)

Collects metrics from GitHub, Discord, Supabase, npm, and Google Analytics every Sunday at 14:00 UTC and sends a consolidated report via Telegram.

**Architecture:** Single `index.js` file (no npm dependencies at runtime). All source collectors, formatter, and Telegram sender in one file.

**Cron:** `0 14 * * 0` (Sundays 14:00 UTC / 11:00 AM Chile)

```bash
cd cloudflare-workers/pulse
npm run dev          # Local dev
npx wrangler deploy  # Deploy

# Manual trigger
curl -X POST https://pulse-weekly-report.SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRIGGER_SECRET"

# Test single source
curl -X POST "https://pulse-weekly-report.SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/trigger?source=github" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRIGGER_SECRET"

# Dry run (no Telegram)
curl -X POST "https://pulse-weekly-report.SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/trigger?send=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRIGGER_SECRET"
```

**Secrets (Cloudflare):**
```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN          # Shared with docs-monitor
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID            # Shared with docs-monitor
GITHUB_TOKEN                # GitHub PAT (public_repo scope)
SUPABASE_URL                # Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY   # Supabase service role key
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN           # Discord bot token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID            # Discord server ID
TRIGGER_SECRET              # For manual /trigger endpoint
GA_PROPERTY_ID              # GA4 property ID (optional)
GA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON     # Base64 service account (optional)
```

**Graceful degradation:** Each source catches its own errors. Missing secrets or API failures show `⚠️ Unavailable` instead of crashing the report. Failed collectors are also reported to Sentry via `sentry.js` (see Error Tracking below). The Vercel collector was removed (2026-07) since the dashboard no longer deploys to Vercel.

### newsletter (Weekly Community Components Email)

Composes and sends a simple weekly email via Resend featuring trending components (one Skill, Agent, MCP, Hook and Setting per send, in that fixed order). Selection is weighted-random by recent downloads and the copy (subject, catalog intro, per-component sentences, stats cited, closer) rotates from pools so no two emails read the same. Body is plain text plus a minimal HTML version (bold + underlined component titles, clickable component links). Data comes from the live `trending-data.json` + `components.json`.

**Delivery:** Resend **Broadcast** targeting the segment in `RESEND_SEGMENT_ID` — Resend injects the per-recipient unsubscribe link (`{{{RESEND_UNSUBSCRIBE_URL}}}` placeholder in the body) and manages the suppression list automatically. Replies go to `NEWSLETTER_REPLY_TO`. The segment is the safety gate: point it at a pilot segment for tests or the full-audience segment for community-wide sends. Open/click tracking is enabled on the `aitmpl.com` domain with tracking subdomain `track.aitmpl.com` (metrics per broadcast at resend.com/broadcasts). Cron: Sundays 16:00 UTC (slot freed by decommissioning docs-monitor). `GET /preview?format=text` composes without sending; `POST /trigger` sends (`?send=false` for dry run).

```bash
cd cloudflare-workers/newsletter
npm run dev          # Local dev
npx wrangler deploy  # Deploy

# Preview content without sending (repeat to see the copy rotate)
curl "https://aitmpl-newsletter.SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/preview?format=text" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRIGGER_SECRET"

# Real send: creates + sends a Broadcast to the segment in RESEND_SEGMENT_ID
curl -X POST "https://aitmpl-newsletter.SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/trigger" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRIGGER_SECRET"
```

**Secrets (Cloudflare):** `RESEND_API_KEY` (full access — broadcasts/segments), `RESEND_SEGMENT_ID`, `NEWSLETTER_REPLY_TO`, `TRIGGER_SECRET`, `SENTRY_DSN` (optional). Public vars in `wrangler.toml [vars]`: `DASHBOARD_URL`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (`daniel.avila@aitmpl.com`).

## Error Tracking (Sentry)

Free-tier Sentry, added to close the gap where automated cron/worker failures
were previously invisible. No official `@sentry/*` SDK is used anywhere —
every surface has its own tiny dependency-free client that posts directly to
the Sentry envelope API via `fetch()`, matching this repo's zero-dependency
worker style and avoiding Cloudflare Pages SSR friction with `@sentry/astro`.

**Status as of 2026-07-04: all 3 projects live and verified end-to-end** (each
confirmed with a manual test event returning HTTP 200 from Sentry and
appearing in its Issues dashboard).

- ✅ **Cloudflare Workers** (Sentry project `aitmpl-workers`) — `SENTRY_DSN`
  secret set on all 3 workers (`aitmpl-crons`, `pulse-weekly-report`,
  `claude-docs-monitor`) via `wrangler secret put SENTRY_DSN`.
- ✅ **Dashboard** (Sentry project `aitmpl-dashboard`) — `SENTRY_DSN` set as a
  Cloudflare Pages secret (`wrangler pages secret put SENTRY_DSN
  --project-name=aitmpl-dashboard`). Wired into `captureApiError()` calls in
  `claude-code-check`, `health-check`, and the three `track-*` endpoints.
- ✅ **CLI** (Sentry project `aitmpl-cli`) — the DSN is public by design
  (send-only, not a secret) and ships **hardcoded as the default** in
  `cli-tool/src/error-reporting.js` (`DEFAULT_SENTRY_DSN`, overridable via
  `CCT_SENTRY_DSN` for testing against a different project). Reporting
  itself stays **opt-in**: requires the end user to set
  `CCT_ERROR_REPORTING=true`, and always defers to the existing
  `CCT_NO_TRACKING`/`CCT_NO_ANALYTICS`/`CI` opt-outs.

**Not yet configured (any surface):** Sentry alert rules to Discord/Telegram,
and Cron Monitors dashboards for the workers' scheduled check-ins (the
`checkIn()` calls already send `in_progress`/`ok`/`error` events — a Monitor
just needs to be created in the Sentry UI with matching slugs:
`claude-code-check`, `health-check`, `pulse-weekly-report`, `docs-monitor`).

**Files:** `cloudflare-workers/{crons,pulse,docs-monitor}/sentry.js` (workers),
`dashboard/src/lib/api/error-tracking.ts` (dashboard), `cli-tool/src/error-reporting.js` (CLI).

## Dashboard (www.aitmpl.com)

Astro + React + Tailwind dashboard serving both `www.aitmpl.com` and `app.aitmpl.com`. Clerk auth for user collections. Source lives in `dashboard/`. All API endpoints are Astro API routes in the same project.

### Architecture

- **Framework**: Astro 5 with React islands, Tailwind v4, `output: 'server'`, `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter (`mode: 'directory'`)
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages (project `aitmpl-dashboard`), SSR on Workers runtime
- **Auth**: Clerk (`window.Clerk` global, no ClerkProvider per island)
- **Data**: `components.json` and `trending-data.json` served from `dashboard/public/` (same-origin)
- **APIs**: All endpoints in `dashboard/src/pages/api/` (Astro API routes, no separate serverless project)

### Featured Pages (`/featured/[slug]`)

Featured partner integrations shown on the dashboard homepage. Two files to edit:

**`dashboard/src/lib/constants.ts`** — `FEATURED_ITEMS` array. Each entry has:
- `name`, `description`, `logo`, `url` (`/featured/slug`), `tag`, `tagColor`, `category`
- `ctaLabel`, `ctaUrl`, `websiteUrl`
- `installCommand` — shown in the sidebar Quick Install box
- `metadata` — key/value pairs shown in the Details sidebar (e.g. `Components: '8'`)
- `links` — sidebar links list

**`dashboard/src/pages/featured/[slug].astro`** — Content for each slug rendered via `{slug === 'brightdata' && (...)}` blocks. Each block contains the full HTML content for that partner page.

**When adding a skill to a featured page:**
1. Add a new card `<div class="flex gap-3 ...">` inside the Skills Layer section of the relevant `{slug === '...'}` block
2. Update `installCommand` in `constants.ts` to include the new skill
3. Increment `metadata.Components` count in `constants.ts`

Current featured slugs: `brightdata`, `neon-instagres`, `claudekit`, `braingrid`

### Cloudflare Pages Project Setup

A single Cloudflare Pages project (`aitmpl-dashboard`) serves all domains. Config lives in `dashboard/wrangler.toml`:

| Project | Domains | Root Directory | Build output |
|---------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| `aitmpl-dashboard` | `www.aitmpl.com`, `aitmpl.com` (redirect), `app.aitmpl.com` | `dashboard` | `dist` |

`wrangler.toml` sets `pages_build_output_dir = "./dist"`, `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]`, and the `PUBLIC_*` build-time vars in `[vars]`. Secrets are set via the Cloudflare Dashboard or `wrangler pages secret put`.

### Deployment

**ALWAYS use the deployer agent (`.claude/agents/deployer.md`) for all deployments.** It runs pre-deploy checks (auth, git status, build) and handles the full pipeline safely. Never deploy manually.

```bash
npm run deploy             # Build + `wrangler pages deploy dist` for www + app.aitmpl.com
npm run deploy:dashboard   # Same as above
```

**CI/CD**: Pushes to `main` auto-deploy via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
- Changes in `dashboard/**` trigger a build and `wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=aitmpl-dashboard`

**Required GitHub Secrets** (Settings > Secrets > Actions):
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — Cloudflare API token with Pages edit permission
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` — Cloudflare account ID

### Environment Variables (Cloudflare)

`PUBLIC_*` vars are build-time and live in `dashboard/wrangler.toml` `[vars]` (and are also passed to the GitHub Actions build step). Everything else is a Cloudflare secret (`wrangler pages secret put <NAME>` or the Pages dashboard):

```bash
# Clerk
PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=xxx   # [vars] — build-time
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=xxx               # secret

# Data
PUBLIC_COMPONENTS_JSON_URL=/components.json   # [vars] — build-time

# GitHub OAuth
PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=xxx        # [vars] — build-time
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx           # secret

# Supabase (download tracking)
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co        # secret
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx               # secret

# Neon Database
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require   # secret

# Discord
DISCORD_APP_ID=xxx                 # secret
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=xxx              # secret
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=xxx             # secret
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_CHANGELOG=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx   # secret
```

### Known Issues & Solutions

**Node built-ins in SSR**
- The Cloudflare Workers runtime does not expose Node's `fs`/`path`/etc. by default. `astro.config.mjs` enables `nodejs_compat` (via `wrangler.toml`) and externalizes `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:url`, `node:stream` in SSR. Avoid adding new hard dependencies on Node-only APIs in server code.

**`react-dom/server` on Cloudflare**
- `astro.config.mjs` aliases `react-dom/server` to `react-dom/server.node` and marks `react-dom` as `noExternal` at build time so React SSR works on the Workers runtime. Don't remove this alias.

### Local Development

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npx astro dev --port 4321   # Dashboard + APIs at http://localhost:4321
```

## Data Files

### Component Catalog

- `docs/components.json` — Full generated catalog (source of truth), keeps `content` and `security` fields (needed by the legacy static site)
- `dashboard/public/components.json` — Dashboard copy, **without** `content`/`security` (lighter payload; dashboard doesn't need them)
- `dashboard/public/counts.json` — Per-type counts only (e.g. `{"agents": 421, ...}`), used by the sidebar/plugins pages instead of loading the full catalog
- `dashboard/public/components/{type}.json` — One file per component type (agents.json, commands.json, etc.), loaded on demand by `ComponentGrid.tsx` for the active tab
- `dashboard/public/search-index.json` — Flat array for `SearchModal.tsx`
- `dashboard/public/component-content/{type}/{slug}.json` — Full per-component content (incl. markdown body), fetched on demand when a component's detail view or PR flow needs it
- `dashboard/public/trending-data.json` — Trending/download stats

All of the above are served as static Cloudflare Pages assets with
`cache-control: public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=3600` (see
`dashboard/public/_headers`).

### Data Flow

1. `scripts/generate_components_json.py` scans `cli-tool/components/`
2. Generates `docs/components.json` (full, with `content`/`security`) and the split dashboard artifacts (`dashboard/public/components.json`, `counts.json`, `components/{type}.json`, `search-index.json`, `component-content/{type}/{slug}.json`) — these two writes are decoupled, so the dashboard payload stays lean without touching the legacy catalog
3. Dashboard islands (`ComponentGrid.tsx`, `SearchModal.tsx`, `Sidebar.astro`, `SendToRepoModal.tsx`) load the split artifacts instead of the full catalog
4. Download tracking via `/api/track-download-supabase`

### Plugins & Marketplaces Catalog

- `scripts/generate_plugins_json.py` — scans the repos listed in `REPOS` via the `gh` CLI (needs `gh auth login`) and writes `dashboard/public/plugins.json`. This is a **manual, offline step** — it does not run during `npm run build` or CI/CD, so re-running it never affects deploy time.
- For each marketplace it records `plugins_list[].components` (counts per type) and `plugins_list[].components_items` (`{name, description}` per command/agent/skill/hook/mcp/lsp, description parsed from the item's frontmatter). The dashboard's `/plugins/[slug].astro` page renders this through `MarketplacePluginsList.tsx`, which shows a search box and a "view details" modal per plugin.
- **`max_local_scans = 50`** in `extract_marketplace_plugins_detail()` caps how many *locally-sourced* plugins (i.e. `source: "./plugins/..."` within the marketplace's own repo) get scanned for real component names/descriptions, per marketplace, to bound GitHub API calls. Plugins beyond that cap (or plugins hosted in an external repo, which are never scanned) fall back to showing only tag badges in the modal, with no itemized breakdown — this is a graceful degradation, not an error.
  - As of 2026-07-11, `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` alone has 51 locally-sourced plugins (out of 255 total), i.e. already at the edge of this cap. Bump `max_local_scans` if more complete coverage is needed — GitHub's rate limit (5000 req/hour authenticated) is not the constraint, wall-clock run time is (each item now costs 1 extra API call to fetch its file content for the description).

### Legacy Static Site (docs/)

The `docs/` directory contains the old static HTML site (no longer deployed to www). Blog articles in `docs/blog/` are still referenced externally.

### Blog Article Creation

Use the CLI skill to create blog articles:

```bash
/create-blog-article @cli-tool/components/{type}/{category}/{name}.json
```

This automatically:
1. Generates AI cover image
2. Creates HTML with SEO optimization
3. Updates `docs/blog/blog-articles.json`

## Code Standards

### Path Handling
- Use relative paths: `.claude/scripts/`, `.claude/hooks/`
- Never hardcode absolute paths or home directories
- Use `path.join()` for cross-platform compatibility

### Naming Conventions
- Files: `kebab-case.js`, `PascalCase.js` (for classes)
- Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Components: `hyphenated-names`

### Error Handling
- Use try/catch for async operations
- Provide helpful error messages
- Log errors with context
- Implement fallback mechanisms

## Testing

```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Coverage report
```

Aim for 70%+ test coverage. Test critical paths and error handling.

## Common Issues

**API endpoint returns 404 after deploy**
- API routes must be in `dashboard/src/pages/api/` as Astro API routes
- Export named HTTP methods: `export const POST: APIRoute`, `export const GET: APIRoute`

**Download tracking not working**
- Check Cloudflare Pages logs: `npx wrangler pages deployment tail --project-name=aitmpl-dashboard`
- Verify environment variables / secrets in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard
- Test endpoint manually with curl

**Components not updating on website**
- Run `python scripts/generate_components_json.py` (writes both `docs/components.json` and the split `dashboard/public/` artifacts directly — no manual copy step)
- Deploy and clear browser cache (artifacts are cached 24h at the edge, see `dashboard/public/_headers`)

## Important Notes

- **Component catalog**: Always regenerate after adding/modifying components
- **API tests**: Required before production deploy (breaks download tracking)
- **Secrets**: Never commit API keys (use environment variables)
- **Paths**: Use relative paths for all project files
- **Backwards compatibility**: Don't break existing component installations
